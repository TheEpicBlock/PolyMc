        <h2>What is currently working?</h2>
        <div>
          <span class="status-cube green"></span>
          PolyMc provides good support for this. You can decently use a mod with these with a vanilla client, as far as that is possible.<br>
          <span class="status-cube orange"></span>
          These won't crash the client. You can still play with these but you might not be able to fully use them.<br>
          <span class="status-cube red"></span>
          PolyMc doesn't support this yet. They might crash the client, they might not.<br>
          <em>all of the information here applies to the latest development build</em><br>
        
          <div class="status-header"><h3>Items</h3><span class="status-bar green"></span></div>
          99% of items work fully on a vanilla client. 
          You might encounter issues with items that use custom renders or edit their appearance with custom properties.
          In general you should be completely fine with using items with PolyMc.
          
          <div class="status-header"><h3>Blocks</h3><span class="status-bar orange"></span></div>
          Blocks need to consider their clientside collision shapes. And be careful not to replace any vanilla blocks. 
          A few block shapes have been implemented in PolyMc:
          <ul>
            <li>Full blocks: 799</li>
            <li>Doors: 8</li>
            <li>Trapdoors: 8</li>
            <li>Uncollidable blocks: 15</li>
            <li>Path blocks: 5</li>
          </ul>
          Note that some transparent textures might display incorrectly.
          
          <div class="status-header"><h3>GUIs</h3><span class="status-bar red"></span></div>
          GUIs do not work currently but are the next priority.
          
          <div class="status-header"><h3>Entities</h3><span class="status-bar red"></span></div>
          There is no support for entities in PolyMc yet. Any modded entity will display as a pig.

          <div class="status-header"><h3>Enchantments</h3><span class="status-bar green"></span></div>
          Custom enchantments are supported and should display correctly on the item.
          Unless the enchantment has some clientside ability it should also be fully functional.

          <div class="status-header"><h3>Recipes</h3><span class="status-bar green"></span></div>
          Custom recipes will work in a crafting table, furnace or other.
          
          <div class="status-header"><h3>Packets</h3><span class="status-bar green"></span></div>
          Custom packets don't do harm and will be ignored by the client. Using the config they can be disabled completely. 
          Look <a href="https://github.com/TheEpicBlock/PolyMc/wiki/Config#custompacketdisabler">here</a> for the advantages of doing this.
