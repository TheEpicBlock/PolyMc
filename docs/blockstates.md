# Unused Block States
!!! note
    This page is purely to document all unused block states in Minecraft, 
    which might be useful to explain PolyMc's behaviour or might help if you're doing some serverside hackery yourself.

## What to pay attention to
 * Render layer
 * Collision box
 * Selection box
 * Whether the state is waterlogged or not

All of these blocks are unused on the client. This means that different states don't have different textures. 
The properties are probably still used on the server. So it's important that you can still differentiate these on the server.
(PolyMc does this by only working in the packet layer, none of the blocks inside the world are actually touched, they're just regular (modded) blocks).

!!! note
    The number of blocks here usually represents the amount of states unless noted otherwise with a *.

!!! warning
    This table has a bunch of information, I have no doubt made a mistake somewhere in here. If you notice any, or if there's an entry missing, please let me know.

[^1]: Only the powered state is currently implemented.
[^2]: Only cave vines without berries are used due to synchronization issues
[^3]: Currently disabled due to issues with tnt being instantly breakable.
[^4]: Only implemented for the air-like case. There are others, but they're a very odd shape. So it's not really worth it.
