# Frequently asked / fully anticipated questions
## Does this work with Bedrock/GeyserMc?
**tl;dr**: no.  

I do not play or use Bedrock often. I do know that the hacks and tricks PolyMc use don't translate well to it.
Bedrock actually includes ways to do a lot better than we can on Java.
A project allowing mods on Bedrock should be separate from PolyMc.
If such a project comes into existence I will try to add compatibility with it in PolyMc, 
so that both projects can be used together, with PolyMc only affecting java clients.

## Why is this block stone?
PolyMc can't handle all collision shapes and there's a finite limit of blocks that can be added. See [the status page](status.html).
